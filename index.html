              The water infiltrates into the ground. It then is pumped back to the surface from stations called "Pumping stations." the water then will be treated (filtered) into potable (drinkable) water then into your home.</p>

                Point source pollution is pollution that is from a single identifiable source from which pollutants are discharged.

                Factories and Water treatment plants are two common examples of point source pollution. Some factories discharge their effluents straight into water bodies while others treat it before it is released. This can cause severe damage to human health and wild lives health.

                <br><br>
              Since these sediments sink to the bottom of the water, it makes the water much clearer. But too much of it can increase the cost of treating drinking water. It can also clog fishes' gills, reduce resistance to diseases and reproductions. Water bodies that are polluted with sediments become cloudy, preventing animals from seeing their food.</p>
